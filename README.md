this encoder was used on https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/ and the purpose for it is to calculate factorials.
i am planning on adding it to the other calculator as well, and i am still thinking of ideas for the calculator.

to use the factorial calculator, its simple. all you have to do is input a number that you want/need the factorial of, and the output will
be the factorial. However, sometimes depending on what compiler you are using, you might need to run the command a few times for it to
actually answer you.
